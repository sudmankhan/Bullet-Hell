Sudman Khan, Andrew Hur

A Bullet Hell genre game, in which the player controls an avatar that is able to shoot. There will be enemies floating around the space as well that shoot at the player and try to kill it. The goal is to shoot the enemies all while dodging barrages of bullets shooting through space at you.
