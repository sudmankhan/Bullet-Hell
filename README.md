# Bullet-Hell
APCS Spring 2022 Final Project, Bullet Hell

Group: Dodgers

Sudman Khan, Andrew Hur

A Bullet Hell genre game, in which the player controls an avatar that is able to shoot. There will be enemies floating around the space as well that shoot at the player and try to kill it. The goal is to shoot the enemies all while dodging barrages of bullets shooting through space at you.


Dev Log

5/23/22
Sudman - Made the game files and classes that we needed based on the UML diagram. Wrote constructors for each class except Bullet. Wrote display methods for player and enemy and tested them.

5/24/22
(Morning) Andrew - Wrote control methods for Player. In testing process. Mouse movement moves fine, wasd movement currently not working. Switching between modes is also not working. Will fix bugs later.

5/24/22
Sudman - Fixed keyboard control methods for Player. Wrote the constructor for the bullet class and wrote the shoot method for bullets and made it so that players can now shoot bullets in a straight line. Made it so that players cannot go past the borders of the game window. Finally, changed the background color to black and the bullet color to yellow. Will probably change later with updated graphics.
